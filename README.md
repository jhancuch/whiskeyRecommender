# whiskeyRecommender

This project takes a whiskey you have enjoyed in the past and returns to you five of the most similar whiskeys based upon nose, palate, and finish using Jaccard Similarity scores. 

## Data:
The reviews and tasting notes are collected from the Whiskey Consensus website (https://whiskeyconsensus.com/). The scraped data is not made publicly accessible but the scripts that utilize the data are included in this repository.
